### Backgorund

The Flexbox Layout module aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic.

The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (and order) to best fill the available space. A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

### Basic and Terminology

![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/00-basic-terminology.svg)

| terminology | description |
|:--:|:--:|
| main axis | The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. |
| main-start, main-end | The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end. |
| main-size | A flex item's width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item's main size. |
| cross-size | The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. |
| cross-start, cross-end | Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side. |
| cross size | The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item's cross size. |

### Properties for the parent

#### display

![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/01-container.svg)

This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.
```css
.container {
  display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
}
```

#### flex-direction
This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container.

```css
.container {
  flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
}
```

#### flex-wrap
By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.

```css
.container{
  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
}
```

#### flex-flow
This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex container's main and cross axes. The default value is row nowrap.

```css
flex-flow: <‘flex-direction’> || <‘flex-wrap’>
```

#### justify-content

This defines the alignment along the main axis.

```css
.container {
  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;
}
```

#### align-items
This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line.

```css
.container {
  align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline;
}
```

![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/align-items.svg)

#### align-content
This aligns a flex container's lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.

    This property has no effect when there is only one line of flex items.

Once your flex items wrap to a new line, you need to learn how to control the positioning of those lines. This is what align-content is all about. 

```css
.container {
  align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | stretch;
}
```

### Properties for the children

#### order
By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.

```css
.item {
  order: <integer>; /* default is 0 */
}
```

#### flex-grow
This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.

If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others.

```css
.item {
  flex-grow: <number>; /* default 0 */
}
```

#### flex-shrink
This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.

```css
.item {
  flex-shrink: <number>; /* default 1 */
}
```

**eg.**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <style>
        .container {
            width: 300px;
            height: 500px;
            display: flex;
        }
        .item {
            height: 120px;
            flex-basis: 106px;
            flex-grow: 1;
        }
        .item.first {
            background-color: red;
            flex-shrink: 2;
        }
        .item.second {
            background: blue;
            flex-shrink: 3;
        }
        .item.third {
            background-color:green;
            flex-shrink: 1;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="item first"></div><!-- width: 100px -->
        <div class="item second"></div><!-- width: 97px -->
        <div class="item third"></div><!-- width: 103px -->
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

#### flex-basis
This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. 

1. The auto keyword means "look at my width or height property" 
2. The content keyword means "size it based on the item's content"


    If no flex-basis is specified, then the flex-basis falls back to the item's width property.

    If no width is specified, then the flex-basis falls back to the computed width of the item's contents.

    Flex-basis value is limited by both the min-width and max-width of the item.

A best practice is to just use flex-basis instead of width or height.

```css
.item {
  flex-basis: <length> | auto; /* default auto */
}
```

#### flex
This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. Default is 0 1 auto.

```css
.item {
  flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]
}
```

#### align-self
This allows the default alignment to be overridden for individual flex items.

    Note that float, clear and vertical-align have no effect on a flex item.

```css
.item {
  align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
}
```
